# Capstone_Rec_Systems

## Introduction
In this project, I created a Colaborative-Filtering (SVD) model recommending restaurants to a user with similar ratings of other silimar restaraunts. Utilizing Yelp open JSON files, I merged and cleaned over 8 million data entries to run within Surprise modeling.

## Buisness Case
The importance of a Recommendation System is to retain the interest of the user or subscriber to the brand or product they originally had interest on. Without a quality rec system in place, a user can lose interest in a brand due to irrelevant content. Think about when you're watching your favorite show on your preferred streaming device. At the end of the series, there's a pop-up at the bottom of your screen suggesting a new show to watch based on your preferred genre or type of show you just finished. This isn't just a random new series drawn out of a hat! Most likely, the streaming device has a recommendation system being utilized to learn your preferences and base it's suggestions to you from your viewed shows and how you rated them along with other users that have rated similarly to you.
